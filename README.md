Your task is to make `docker build` complete successfully without changing the version of LLM Foundry or the base Docker image. You can get started by cloning this repository and running:

```
$ docker build -t solution .
```

When you're done:
1. Upload your solution as a Git `.patch` file to the work test submission form emailed to you (do NOT open a pull request)
2. Attach or link to a document explaining your thought process and debugging steps
